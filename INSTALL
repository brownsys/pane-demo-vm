Procedure to create a fresh PANE demo VM:

1) Install Ubuntu Server 64-bit in a Virtual Box VM (1 GB RAM, 20 GB HDD)
   - Hostname: panedemo, User: paneuser / paneuser
   - No LVM, disk encryption, or other features

2) After the new OS boots, login and do:
   cd /tmp
   wget https://raw.github.com/brownsys/pane-demo-vm/master/bin/configure-vm.sh
   bash ./configure-vm.sh --pane

3) Upon reboot, you should be brought to the XFCE desktop environment and
   logged-in as paneuser.

4) Finish-up by installing the Virtual Box Guest Additions

Bonus... If you want to free some space in your spare image:

1) In your guest OS, do:
   $ cat /dev/zero  > zeros ; sync ; sleep 1 ; sync ; rm -f zeros
2) Then, shutdown guest OS, and in the host OS, do:
   $ VBoxManage modifyhd --compact /path/to/image.vdi

If you use VMWare instead of Virtual Box, the procedure to shrink the
zero'd disk is to install the guest OS tools, and run vmware-toolbox
from within the guest OS.

============================================

NOTE:
You can also create Frenetic and FlowLog VM's using the tools in this repo.

1) In step (1) above, use "frenetic" or "flowlog" instead of the "pane*"
   names as appropriate

2) In step (2) above, use the flags "--frenetic" or "--flowlog" instead
   of "--pane"
